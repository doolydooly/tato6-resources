# tato6-resources
Resource pack designed for use with tato6 modpack.

1. Put the root `tato6` folder in the `resourcepacks` folder
2. To enable by default, add `resourcePacks:["tato6"]` to the server `options.txt`
3. If not enabled in the server `options.txt`, users will have to manually turn the pack on in the client
